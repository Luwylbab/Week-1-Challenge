# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

    -I did this project to refactor the code of an existing website, but not change how it works
    
    - My motivation was to make the site more accesible, and optimize it for search engines

    - I condensed the stylehseet to make the code more effecient, I altered the language to change the non-semantic elements into semantic elements, I added accessibility options to the images,
    I reviewed the code to make sure it followed a logical order, and I gave the webpage a more clear and concise title

    - I learned more about the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements, and how to write html and css more efficiently.
